# Resume-classification-tool


This project helps HR professionals and recruiters automatically classify resumes into relevant job categories using a machine learning model trained on real-world data. Upload any resume in .pdf, .docx, or .txt format, and the app will predict the most suitable job role from 25 categories.


## Project overview

### üîß  Working of the Project

Step-by-Step Flow:

File Upload: User uploads resumes in .pdf, .docx, or .txt format.

1. Text Extraction: Text is extracted based on file type.

2. Text Cleaning: The text is cleaned by removing links, special characters, and redundant spaces.

3. Vectorization: Cleaned text is converted into numerical data using TF-IDF.

4. Prediction: KNN model classifies the resume into one of 25 predefined job categories.

5. Output: The predicted job role is displayed and exportable as CSV.

###  Implementation Details
üîç Preprocessing:
Removal of stop words, URLs, and special characters.

Normalization of text using regex and whitespace stripping.

#### üß∞ Machine Learning:
